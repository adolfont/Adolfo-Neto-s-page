## BEAM (Erlang, Elixir) Community

I am a member of the [Education, Training, & Adoption Working Group](https://erlef.org/wg/education) of the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/).

I have created the [Elixir World](http://t.me/elixir_world) group on Telegram.

I give talks on Elixir whenever asked (and it fits my schedule).

I have a YouTube channel called [Elixir, Erlang and the BEAM with Adolfo Neto](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElixirErlangandtheBEAMwithAdolfoNeto).

I am co-creator and one of the hosts of the [Elixir em Foco podcast](https://anchor.fm/elixiremfoco/) - in Portuguese.
