## BEAM (Erlang, Elixir) Community

I am a member of the [Education, Training, & Adoption Working Group](https://erlef.org/wg/education) of the [Erlang Ecosystem Foundation](https://erlef.org/).

I have created the [Elixir World](http://t.me/elixir_world) group on Telegram.

I give talks on Elixir whenever asked (and it fits my schedule).

I have a YouTube channel called [Elixir, Erlang and the BEAM with Adolfo Neto](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElixirErlangandtheBEAMwithAdolfoNeto). I also have [a more generic chanel in Portuguese where some of the videos are about Elixir and Erlang](https://www.youtube.com/c/AdolfoNeto). For instance, there is this playlist where I am covering [Fred Hebert's Learn You Some Erlang for Great Good!: A Beginner's Guide book](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF5ttO8F-IsTided30sMhUx-5Rfyeur65).

I am co-creator and one of the hosts of the [Elixir em Foco podcast](https://anchor.fm/elixiremfoco/) - in Portuguese.


üîä In 2019, I was a guest of the Elixir Mix podcast: [EMx 057: The Elixir Community with Adolfo Neto](https://dev.to/elixirmix/emx-057-the-elixir-community-with-adolfo-neto).

üîä In 2020, I was again a guest of the Elixir Mix podcast: [EMx 106: Elixir Education with Adolfo Neto](https://devchat.tv/uncategorized/emx-106-elixir-education-with-adolfo-neto/).

üîä If you can understand Portuguese, I was interviewed by Ruben Salomao in [RS Entrevista Professor Adolfo Neto
](https://www.rubensalomao.me/2020/07/rs-entrevista-professor-adolfo-neto.html).
